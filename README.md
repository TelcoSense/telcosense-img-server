# telcosense-img-server

Simple raingrid and temperature map image server.

## Overview

This repository provides a lightweight image server for serving precomputed raingrid and related raster data products. It is primarily intended for serving image outputs generated by the `telcorain` and `telcotemp` processing pipelines.

The server is designed to act as a backend component for visualization platforms and web applications, enabling efficient access to static or time-indexed image data with minimal overhead.

## Contents

- HTTP image-serving backend
- Support for TelcoRain and TelcoTemp image outputs
- Time-indexed raster product handling
- Simple directory-based data organization
- Utilities and helpers for serving generated outputs

## Usage

The server can be run as a standalone service or deployed as part of the broader ecosystem.  
Configuration and usage details depend on the deployment scenario and are documented inline or in accompanying scripts.
